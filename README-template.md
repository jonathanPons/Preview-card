## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
  -Media Queries

### What I learned

I worked on my media queries, my :Hover and my :active

It took me 4 hours to complete this project.

### Continued development

I couldn't find the shopping cart image, so I had to find one online. The result isn't the same, but I did my best. Additionally, I relied less on ChatGPT, so I'm still happier with the outcome. I'm waiting for the community's feedback on the responsiveness.
